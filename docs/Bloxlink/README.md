## What is Bloxlink?

Bloxlink is a Roblox integration for Discord. We add the ability to bring over Roblox to your Discord server by syncing Group roles to Server roles, linking Roblox accounts to Discord accounts, and more. You can read more on [our website](https://blox.link)

We're on a mission to simplify integrating Roblox into Discord so players and groups can spend more time connecting with their friends and communities.
