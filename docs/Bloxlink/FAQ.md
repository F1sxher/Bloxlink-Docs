## How do I verify?

The first step to verifying is running `!verify` in any server. Bloxlink will send you a link to our website and you can verify from there. If you're having any issues, we do have a [guide to help you](../Guides/Verification/verify.md).

## How do I access the website?

The website can be found by going into a browser and typing `https://blox.link` in your search bar. You can also [click here](https://blox.link).

## How do I become a Trial Helper / Bloxlink Staff Member?

In order to become a Helper, you must’ve been active in our server during your time as a Trial Helper. You must also have shown us that you provide correct support and follow our rules.

## What is Bloxlink Premium / Bloxlink Pro?

Bloxlink Premium is a discontinued form of "pro" where you could get **some** of the patreon-only features that the Bloxlink Pro bot has, but only with the normal Bloxlink Bot.

!!! warning Warning
This is unavailable now, as it used to be a 50 dollar item for a lifetime license. If you already have it linked to your discord account you can still use it.
!!!

Bloxlink Pro is our premium bot. You can buy this for $6 a month and receive all of our features of premium. You can subscribe to our [patreon](https://patreon.com/bloxlink) to get the pro features. If you use `!help`, you can see what the faster and more reliable premium bot offers under the Premium section. You can also [check it here]().

## How do I donate?

Firstly, you can go to our website and click "Premium". This will redirect you to our donation page. You may also visit [our patreon here](https://patreon.com/bloxlink). It may take up to 20 minutes for the bot to recognize that you have bought premium, so please be patient after buying it. Make sure to sign in with your Discord account on the website under “My membership” in order to receive the perks.

## Why is Bloxlink not changing my nickname?

This is most likely because you are the server owner. This is a thing that Discord made bots unable to, and not Bloxlink. We can’t do anything about it, so you must just name yourself manually. 

In case you are not the server owner, then it might have something to do with Bloxlink’s permissions. Firstly, make sure to drag the bot to the top of the roles you want it to change nicknames on. If it still doesn’t change your nickname, ensure Bloxlink has the `Manage Nicknames` permission.

## I deleted my data! How do I get it back?

!!! failure Notice
Once you have deleted your data, **there is nothing we can do about it**. The page **warns** you multiple times and even asks for confirmation before you delete your data. This is not our fault as you were warned about this and we can not do anything to fix it. You **must** wait 2 days before being able to verify again.
!!!

!!! warning Warning
Asking to be let back into your account before the 48 hour period has finished may & will result in a longer wait. If it says 0 days left, that means it still has less than a day left. In a future update, the website will display the number of hours as well.
!!!

## Bloxlink isn't responding! What do I do?

There are a few reasons Bloxlink may not be responding to you. First off, try `@Bloxlink prefix`. Please remember to ping the bot, and not the Bloxlink role! Sometimes, your prefix might be different so the bot is not responding. If the bot is offline, an update and/or outage could be happening, check our status channel on [Discord](https://blox.link/support) for more information. Be patient as this is being fixed as soon as possible.

## How do I link my Roblox Group?

If you have **`administrative`** permission in a server, you may run `!setup` and follow the prompts in Direct Messages. 

!!! tip Tip
If you have difficulties in finding the group ID, just take the numbers from the Group URL just before the group name or you can just take the entire URL.
!!!
!!! info Example
https://www.roblox.com/groups/**3587262**/Bloxlink
!!!

If you have already ran a setup, you can use the command called !bind instead; 

First, you would run `!bind`, then choose group, now you will have to set the nicknameTemplate for this group bind. 
!!! tip Tip
Most common nickname template to use are their Roblox Display Names with Roblox Usernames, which is `{smart-name}` or just their roblox username (`{roblox-username}`), you can also say `skip` if you do not want one.
!!!

Then, you'll be prompted if you want your users roles to be removed if they meet the bind requirements, choose based on your preference! This is an advanced option, if you don't really know how it works, say skip.

Finally, say your group ID. After that say entire group.

!!! tip Tip
If you have difficulties in finding the group ID, just take the numbers from the Group URL just before the group name or you can just take the entire URL.
!!!
!!! info Example
https://www.roblox.com/groups/**3587262**/Bloxlink
!!!

## How do I setup or change my nickname template?

To setup a nickname for **all users** that verify/join the server, you do `!settings change nicknameTemplate`. It will give you a list of things you can set users' nicknames to, and you can customize their nickname. This is meant for all users in the server. A common one to use is `{smart-name}`, this will name people their Roblox name (and their Display name, if they have any).

## What is Bloxlink Canary?

Bloxlink Canary is a feature bot, that is updated to test out our new features before they are released on `Bloxlink#6871` or/and `Bloxlink Pro#2989`. You can read more about Bloxlink Canary by reacting to “QA Program Member” in the `#get-a-role` channel in our Discord server.

!!! note Note
Bloxlink Canary is for testing. It is not recommended to be used as a main bot, instead, to be used for testing new features. You may test features early with Canary.
!!!

!!! tip You can learn more about Canary here
[Guide to Canary](../Guides/Other/Canary.md)
!!!

## I bought Bloxlink Pro! Do I have to redo all my binds and setup?

No, you don’t have to do anything over again. Data are synced with the server, which means settings, binds, prefix and everything else will remain the same as before if you decide to invite Bloxlink Pro to your server. 
The same happens if you one day want to cancel your Bloxlink subscription. Things will still be synced to the server, and it will remain the same on the normal Bloxlink.

!!! warning Notice
Once you cancel your subscription you must re-invite the normal Bloxlink, as Bloxlink Pro is only for active Bloxlink premium/Pro subscribers.
!!!

## What are magic roles? How do I set them?

Magic roles are roles that will allow you to do administrative things ONLY within Bloxlink! 

For example if you want to allow someone to run the `!update/!verifyall` command, but don't want to grant them the Manage Server permission. That's what these "Magic Roles" do. There are 3 types of magic roles: 

**Bloxlink Bypass**: This will make Bloxlink ignore the people with this role. They will for example be ignored if someone runs `!update` on them. This way they can have a custom name and have roles that Bloxlink would normally remove.

**Bloxlink Updater**: This will allow people to run the `!update` command on others as well as the `!verifyall` command. This is very smart if you for example updated someone's group rank, and want someone to update the "suspect".

**Bloxlink Admin**: This will allow people to be able to run all commands with Bloxlink. This is a dangerous role to give people, if you don't trust them. Be careful, cause they will be able to change settings within Bloxlink, delete binds (linked groups and other binds), setup the bot again and such administrative permissions.

!!! note Note
With a recent Bloxlink update, all **pro** and **premium** users may customize the role names for **Bloxlink Bypass**, **Bloxlink Updater**, and **Bloxlink Admin**.
!!!

!!! note Note
Please note that you don't have to set **any actual permissions** for these roles. It's coded in the bot. 
Please also make sure that you spell them correct, as if you don't it won't work (Yes, capitalization also matters!). **Bloxlink Bypass**, **Bloxlink Updater**, and **Bloxlink Admin**.
!!!

## I have modified my settings/binds but it did not take effect!
If you have a Trello board linked to your server, then the bot will only load up to **100** cards from the board. If you have more than 100 total cards on your board, then the bot might fail to find the Trello cards to remove/modify. So, changing settings in your server will appear to have no effect. It's recommended to use a brand new board for your Bloxlink settings and binds.

!!! danger DEPRECATED
The Trello function has been **deprecated**. You can not link a Trello board anymore. If you have linked one, it is recommended to switch to the normal settings without Trello!
Having difficulties switching to the normal settings? Visit our [support server](https://blox.link/support).
!!!

## People are not getting their roles!

If you have Membership Screening enabled in your Server Settings, then Bloxlink will wait until **after** the user accepts the rules before giving them their roles. This is because giving roles makes a user bypass the Membership Screening, so Bloxlink will always wait until after the user accepts the rules. 
If you don't have Membership Screening enabled, then most likely the bot **is** giving them their roles, but your Discord client isn't showing it. This is a problem with Discord, not the bot, the role is in fact being given to the person. You can double-check by looking at the audit log.

## I see no servers/wrong servers when I try to verify!

You are most likely logged on the wrong account on the website. Go to https://discord.com/, log out, and log back in with your correct account. Then go back to the Bloxlink website and sign in.

## I verified on the website but Bloxlink says I didn't!

If your verification was successful on the website, but Bloxlink says you're not, most likely you're logged into the wrong Discord account on [our website](https://blox.link)

!!! tip Tip
